* (option) Drawer lock
A servo motor to lock and unlock the drawer with the command of the user.

The arduino will control the lock mechanism and sense the weight and the movement of the drawer. 

The raspberry pi will communicate and analyse the data.

## Hardware, programming languages etc.

* Twitter of facebook messenger api to handle the information and communicate with the user.
* Weight/force sensors to controll the items placed in drawer.
* A servo motor for the lock mechanism,
* Wilyodrin, python or a simmilar platform to program the devices and sensors.
